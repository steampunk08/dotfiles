==========

Non of the plugins and or files under this directory are created by me and in
addition I have made no modifications to any of the plugins under this directory.
(off course all of the above does not apply to this README :) )

All the plugins here are the works some dedicated people and would really
hate stealing their thunder. So I have made a list of the plugin sources.

zsh-syntax-highlighting
-----------------------

Author: 
extract:
      This package provides syntax highlighing for the shell zsh.  It enables
      highlighing of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an
      interactive terminal.  This helps in reviewing commands before running
      them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

zsh-autosuggestions 
-------------------

Author:

zsh-completions
---------------

Author:
extract:
      This projects aims at gathering/developing new completion scripts that are 
      not available in Zsh yet. The scripts may be contributed to the Zsh project
      when stable enough.
